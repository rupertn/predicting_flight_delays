# Will Your Flight Be Delayed?
### Project Overview
  - Scraped more than 5000 aircraft registrations from the FAA website using python and beautifulsoup.
  - Engineered features from aviation weather report text (METARs) to indicate the presence of fog or a thunderstorm at the scheduled departure time.
  - Performed a complex SQL Server join of the flight and weather data on the closest weather report timestamp to the scheduled departure time.
  - Optimized logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models using GridSearchCV to improve model performance in an unbalanced classifcation problem.
